Hello there. My name is Robert Sweeney and I’m a developer, Microsoft technologies enthusiast, and proud father. I’ve been developing against the Microsoft stack for over 15 years, starting with WIN32 API programming and Visual Basic 3.0.  I currently, work as a Principal Consultant at Dell in the IT Consulting Services division specializing in Custom .NET Development, SharePoint 2013, Office 365 and Windows Azure.

I’ve recently become a huge fan of F# and even though I’ve built my career around the Microsoft stack, I enjoy learning about other platforms and technologies in the market. I enjoy rock climbing and autocross; unfortunately, I’ve been unable to dedicate much time to either of those hobbies, lately.  Rather now, I spend most of my time helping out with my wife’s small business and being more active in my various technology communities.
