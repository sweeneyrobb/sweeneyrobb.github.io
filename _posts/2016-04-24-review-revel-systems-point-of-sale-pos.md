My wife owns and operates a retail clothing store. Around 5 years ago she
decided to make the investment in a Point of Sales (POS) system. I helped her
find an option that was user-friendly and affordable. We opted for
Quickbooks Point of Sale 10. This solution has worked great over the years.

Recently she has gotten rather aggressive on scaling her business. She is
adding a new location this month. And, plans are to continue expanding, adding
a location a year. As if this weren't aggressive enough, there are plans to
add an online store to help move inventory, beyond her local customer base.

Naturally, having some sort of centralized system would be ideal. Quickbooks
POS does offer this capability, however, it is less real-time and has a
dependency on the server (which is simple just another workstation) to be
available all the time (or in certain scenarios, during a synchronization).

This kind of uptime is something that she does want to have burden of
maintaining. Additionally, Quickbooks Point of Sale has additional costs for
backend / administrative access. Making the costs grow pretty substantially if
needing remote access. So we decided to migrate into a Cloud based
Point of Sale (POS).

During our evaluation, we found that Intuit, had partnered with Revel Systems.
We felt that this was great. If the company who provided us with our previous
POS system is partnering with another POS company, they must agree on some of
the technical components and overall transition would be seamless (or as
seamless as on could expect moving from an on-premise to a cloud-based system).
Boy were we wrong.
