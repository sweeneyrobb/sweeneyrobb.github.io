I’ve had a couple of Office 365 engagements, where I am explaining current functionality of Office 365 and build expectations around the feature set. All so that Microsoft can make a fool of me and make an update to their service.

We’ve sat in partner advisory councils and explained that it’s difficult to assist in growing the O365 space, as a partner, when we have no in roads to the road map of the service updates. Likely others, have similar frustrations surrounding feature releases to Office 365.

Microsoft has finally heard us and has released an [Office 365 Roadmap](http://bit.ly/1irNTrG), that will keep updated details surrounding feature releases. We finally have visibility to Microsoft’s aggressive update schedule. Thanks Office 365 Team!
